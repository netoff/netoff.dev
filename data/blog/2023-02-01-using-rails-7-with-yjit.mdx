YJIT is a new JIT compiler for Ruby 3.0. With Ruby 3.2 YJIT support finally stabilized.
In this article, I'll show you how to use it on macOS with brew, rbenv, ruby-build and Rails 7.

## What is YJIT?

[YJIT](https://github.com/Shopify/yjit) stands for "Yet Another Ruby JIT" and is a just-in-time (JIT) compiler for the
Ruby programming language, developed by Shopify. It is a runtime optimization technique
that aims to improve the performance of Ruby applications by compiling Ruby code into machine code
on the fly, rather than interpreting it each time it is executed. JIT compilers in general
can provide a significant boost to application performance by allowing the code to be executed
faster and with less overhead.

Starting from Ruby 3.2 YJIT is [not experimental](https://shopify.engineering/ruby-yjit-is-production-ready)
anymore, so it is now suitable for production use. It is a promising development
if you are looking to squeeze and extract the last bit of performance out of the Ruby engine.

## How to install YJIT with rbenv and Ruby 3.2

[rbenv](https://github.com/rbenv/rbenv) is Ruby version manager of my choice and I'll show you how to install YJIT with it.

**To build YJIT you need rust tools installed on your system**(YJIT is written in [Rust](https://www.rust-lang.org)).
If you don't have them, you can install them with [rustup](https://rustup.rs/).
Just follow the instructions on their [website](https://rustup.rs/) and you should be good to go.

Once you have rust tools installed, you can proceed with installing YJIT with rbenv.
Make sure you update ruby-build first. If you are on macOS, and you originally installed rbenv
using [homebrew](https://brew.sh/), you can run:

```bash
brew update && brew upgrade ruby-build
```

Finally you can install Ruby 3.2 with YJIT support(by default YJIT won't be included).
Run the following rbenv command:

```bash
RUBY_CONFIGURE_OPTS="--enable-yjit" rbenv install 3.2.0
```

Make sure to include `RUBY_CONFIGURE_OPTS` flag! This will enable YJIT support.

## How to use YJIT with Rails 7

One simple trick you can use is to modify the [shebang](<https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shebang_(Unix)>)
of the `bin/rails` file and pass the `--yjit` param to the Ruby executable. Instead of just running
it in default interpreted mode.

The top of your `bin/rails` file should look something like this:

```ruby
#!/usr/bin/env ruby --yjit
```

After this change, you can run your Rails application with YJIT enabled by running `bin/rails server` or
`bin/rails s` as usual.

As a bonus tip, you can also enable YJIT for all `bin/` scripts inside your Rails project
by adding `--yjit` param. Other files you should modify are:

- `bin/rake`
- `bin/bundle`
- `bin/setup`

Congratulations ðŸŽ‰ Now your whole Rails project and all the commands will run with YJIT enabled.
