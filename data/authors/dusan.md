Hola! My name is **Dusan**. Some people know me as [netoff](https://github.com/netoff).

Iâ€™ve been in Software Engineering and Web Development for more than half of my life. I have **15+ years** of experience with **Ruby on Rails**, and **7+ years** of experience with
**React/JS**.

I am the [**Ruby School**](https://rubysoft.dev/ruby_school) and [**Turbo Funnel**](https://turbofunnelapp.com) creator, and I running them passionately is what I do day to day. **Ruby School** is the easiest way for non-programmers (e.g., non-technical founders) to learn Web Programming. **Turbo Funnel** is the easiest Inbound marketing tool, helping people turbocharge their conversions
