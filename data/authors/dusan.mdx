Hola! My name is **Dusan**. Some people know me as [netoff](https://github.com/netoff).

Iâ€™ve been in **Software Engineering** and **Web Development** for more than half of my life.
I have **15+ years** of experience with **Ruby on Rails**, and **7+ years** of experience with
**React/JS**.

I am the [**Ruby School**](https://rubysoft.dev/ruby_school) and [**Turbo Funnel**](https://turbofunnelapp.com) creator,
and I running them passionately is what I do day to day. **Ruby School** is the easiest way for non-programmers
(e.g., non-technical founders) to learn Web Programming. **Turbo Funnel** is the easiest Inbound marketing tool,
helping people turbocharge their conversions

My skills include some of the following technologies:

<ul className="m-0 list-none p-0">
  {Object.entries(skills).map(([lang, title], i) => {
    return (
      <li key={i} className="flex bg-gray-800 p-2">
        <Image
          title={title}
          alt={title}
          width="32"
          height="32"
          src={`https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/devicons/devicon/icons/${lang}/${lang}-original.svg`}
        />
        <span className="pl-2 font-bold underline ">{title}</span>
      </li>
    )
  })}
</ul>
