Hola! My name is **Dusan**. Some people know me as [netoff](https://github.com/netoff).

Iâ€™ve been in **Software Engineering** and **Web Development** for more than half of my life.
I have **15+ years** of experience with **Ruby on Rails**.

My skills include some of the following technologies:

<ul className="m-0 list-none p-0">
  {skills.map(([lang, variant, title], i) => {
    return (
      <li key={i} className="flex bg-gray-800 p-2">
        <Image
          title={title}
          alt={title}
          width="32"
          height="32"
          src={`https://cdn.jsdelivr.net/gh/devicons/devicon/icons/${lang}/${variant}.svg`}
        />
        <span className="pl-2 font-bold underline ">{title}</span>
      </li>
    )
  })}
</ul>
